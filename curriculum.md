# curriculum

## ARC 1 - how machines read text
- [x] characters vs words, and why both fail (001)
- [x] what a token is (002)
- [x] BPE: merging by frequency (003)
- [x] tokens are money: how pricing actually works (004)
- [x] why hindi and gujarati cost more than english: tokens per word isnt equal (005)
- [x] context window (006)
- [x] the model cant see inside a token: why it cant count letters (007)
- [x] numbers get chunked, not counted: why arithmetic gets shaky (008)
- [x] a space or a capital letter changes the ids (009)
- [x] CAPSTONE: what the model sees, and what it costs, when i send a request (010)

## ARC 2 - meaning as numbers
- [x] a vector is a list of numbers (011)
- [x] dot product, by hand (012)
- [x] cosine similarity (013)
- [x] what an embedding is (014)
- [x] nearby means similar (015)
- [x] one word, many meanings: context changes the vector (016)
- [x] embedding models are separate products from chat models (017)
- [x] classify with no training: nearest labeled example wins (018)
- [x] near-duplicates: the same score, with a threshold on it (019)
- [x] clustering: finding the groups when nothing is labeled (020)
- [x] CAPSTONE: how search by meaning works end to end (021)

## ARC 3 - whats inside the box (enough to not be fooled, no more)
- [x] next-token prediction is the whole game (022)
- [x] attention in one note: every token looks at every other token, the superpower and the cost (023)
- [x] why compute scales badly with input length (024)
- [x] a parameter is one number the model learned, and 8B is how many (025)
- [x] the model reads every parameter to write one token (026)
- [x] what a bigger model actually buys, and what it doesnt (027)
- [x] training vs inference: baked-in knowledge has a cutoff (028)
- [x] base model vs assistant: what tuning changed (029)
- [x] what fine-tuning can fix and what it cant (030)
- [x] CAPSTONE: the box, closed. everything an applied engineer must know about internals and nothing more (031)

## ARC 4 - how it writes, and the knobs you own
- [x] logits to probabilities (032)
- [x] temperature (033)
- [x] greedy vs sampling: two ways to pick a row (034)
- [x] top-k: keep the best few rows, then rescale what survives (035)
- [x] top-p: cut by running total, and why a fixed k gets it wrong (036)
- [x] theres no row for "i dont know": the list always adds to 100 and something always wins (037)
- [x] why the made-up answer sounds right, and why its not a bug you can patch (038)
- [x] asking the model how sure it is, and why you cant trust the answer (039)
- [x] stop sequences and max tokens (040)
- [x] determinism: why the same prompt varies and what that breaks (041)
- [x] reasoning models: the model does its working out in the open (042)
- [x] thinking tokens on the bill: paying for output you dont get to read (043)
- [x] CAPSTONE: one tokens journey out, and every knob you control (044)

## ARC 5 - the prompt is the program
- [x] the request is a list of role-tagged messages, and it all becomes one token stream (045)
- [x] system vs user: what outranking buys you, and what it doesnt (046)
- [x] conversation state: the model remembers nothing, your code fakes the memory (047)
- [ ] few-shot: showing beats telling
- [ ] structured output: getting json you can actually parse
- [ ] when json breaks: validation and retry
- [ ] tool calling: the model asks, your code acts
- [ ] prompt injection: user input IS code now
- [ ] context budget: what to include when you cant include everything
- [ ] images in: multimodal requests without the mystery
- [ ] CAPSTONE: anatomy of a production prompt

## ARC 6 - RAG: giving the model your data
- [ ] closed-book vs open-book
- [ ] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant
- [ ] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality
- [ ] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context
- [ ] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs
- [ ] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough
- [ ] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap
- [ ] keyword + semantic: hybrid search
- [ ] reranking: cheap search, expensive sort
- [ ] measuring retrieval: recall@k and mrr in plain terms
- [ ] groundedness: did the answer come from the docs
- [ ] CAPSTONE: doc-QA system end to end, every design decision named

## ARC 7 - evals: how you know any of it works
- [ ] "looks good" doesnt scale
- [ ] the golden dataset: 50 examples beat vibes
- [ ] exact match vs semantic scoring
- [ ] llm-as-judge, and its biases
- [ ] the score moved, is it real: why small eval sets lie
- [ ] regression: the prompt change that broke three other things
- [ ] evals in ci: treating prompts like code
- [ ] error analysis: stop guessing, read the failures and bucket them
- [ ] after you ship: thumbs, feedback, and checking quality in the wild
- [ ] CAPSTONE: an eval harness for the arc 6 system

## ARC 8 - running it: speed, cost, and when things break
- [ ] an agent is a while loop with an llm inside
- [ ] when the loop goes wrong: runaway agents and hard stops
- [ ] streaming: why the ui types
- [ ] provider prompt caching: pay less for the part of the prompt that never changes
- [ ] semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice
- [ ] latency and cost budgets: the two numbers that kill llm features
- [ ] rate limits and retries
- [ ] when the provider is down: timeouts, fallbacks, failing gracefully
- [ ] the model changes under you: pinning versions and surviving deprecations
- [ ] observability: logging llm calls like http calls
- [ ] CAPSTONE: what happens after deploy, keeping an llm feature alive

## ARC 9 - the decisions: safety, privacy, and picking your model
- [ ] should this even be an llm: when boring code wins
- [ ] content moderation: the filter in front of and behind the model
- [ ] data leaves the building: pii, redaction, and what the api keeps
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD
baton: 047 answered the question 046 left hanging, which was how the system lean survives past turn one. it does not survive anything, the endpoint keeps nothing between calls and the transcript array in my code is the entire memory. the visual ran three turns side by side, showing my code appending the models own reply back into the array tagged assistant, then re-posting the whole thing, with 2 then 4 then 6 messages going out and 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 input tokens paid on 60 tokens of actual text. established as the takeaway: multi-turn chat is a replay your code performs, the older messages are billed again on every call (004), and the array only grows so it eventually meets the ceiling from 006. the caveat that some apis now store the transcript server side is in, framed as the same replay with the storage moved. context budgeting was deliberately left alone, it is its own checkbox later in this arc.

the next checkbox is "few-shot: showing beats telling". it picks up from 047 hard, because 047 just showed that i am the one filling that array, including the assistant items. so nothing stops me writing assistant turns the model never said, and that is the whole trick of few-shot: the examples are fake earlier turns sitting in the same array from 045. why showing beats telling then falls out of 022 and 029, the model is continuing a pattern rather than reading a rule, so a pattern it can see beats a description of one. the honest caveat is that the examples are re-sent and re-billed on every call exactly like the transcript in 047, so a big example block is a standing cost, and that the model can copy the shape of a bad example just as happily as a good one.

process note: 047 came in at 185 prose words, deliberately shorter after four notes sat between 190 and 210. that reset the uniformity. 048 can sit anywhere in the range.

last visuals: worked example (047), pseudocode (046), annotated artifact (045). 048 is barred from repeating a worked example. a real prompt with two fabricated example turns marked up would suit few-shot well, and mermaid has not been used since 044 if a flow fits better.
last exits: forward (047), stops (046), stops (045). 048 may point forward, but then 049 has to just stop.
