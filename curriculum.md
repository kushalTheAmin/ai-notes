# curriculum

## ARC 1 - how machines read text
- [x] characters vs words, and why both fail (001)
- [x] what a token is (002)
- [x] BPE: merging by frequency (003)
- [x] tokens are money: how pricing actually works (004)
- [x] why hindi and gujarati cost more than english: tokens per word isnt equal (005)
- [x] context window (006)
- [x] the model cant see inside a token: why it cant count letters (007)
- [x] numbers get chunked, not counted: why arithmetic gets shaky (008)
- [x] a space or a capital letter changes the ids (009)
- [x] CAPSTONE: what the model sees, and what it costs, when i send a request (010)

## ARC 2 - meaning as numbers
- [x] a vector is a list of numbers (011)
- [x] dot product, by hand (012)
- [x] cosine similarity (013)
- [x] what an embedding is (014)
- [x] nearby means similar (015)
- [x] one word, many meanings: context changes the vector (016)
- [x] embedding models are separate products from chat models (017)
- [x] classify with no training: nearest labeled example wins (018)
- [x] near-duplicates: the same score, with a threshold on it (019)
- [x] clustering: finding the groups when nothing is labeled (020)
- [x] CAPSTONE: how search by meaning works end to end (021)

## ARC 3 - whats inside the box (enough to not be fooled, no more)
- [x] next-token prediction is the whole game (022)
- [x] attention in one note: every token looks at every other token, the superpower and the cost (023)
- [x] why compute scales badly with input length (024)
- [x] a parameter is one number the model learned, and 8B is how many (025)
- [x] the model reads every parameter to write one token (026)
- [x] what a bigger model actually buys, and what it doesnt (027)
- [x] training vs inference: baked-in knowledge has a cutoff (028)
- [x] base model vs assistant: what tuning changed (029)
- [x] what fine-tuning can fix and what it cant (030)
- [x] CAPSTONE: the box, closed. everything an applied engineer must know about internals and nothing more (031)

## ARC 4 - how it writes, and the knobs you own
- [x] logits to probabilities (032)
- [x] temperature (033)
- [x] greedy vs sampling: two ways to pick a row (034)
- [x] top-k: keep the best few rows, then rescale what survives (035)
- [x] top-p: cut by running total, and why a fixed k gets it wrong (036)
- [x] theres no row for "i dont know": the list always adds to 100 and something always wins (037)
- [x] why the made-up answer sounds right, and why its not a bug you can patch (038)
- [ ] asking the model how sure it is, and why you cant trust the answer
- [ ] stop sequences and max tokens
- [ ] determinism: why the same prompt varies and what that breaks
- [ ] reasoning models: when the model thinks first, and what those tokens cost
- [ ] CAPSTONE: one tokens journey out, and every knob you control

## ARC 5 - the prompt is the program
- [ ] system vs user messages: who outranks whom
- [ ] conversation state: the model remembers nothing, your code fakes the memory
- [ ] few-shot: showing beats telling
- [ ] structured output: getting json you can actually parse
- [ ] when json breaks: validation and retry
- [ ] tool calling: the model asks, your code acts
- [ ] prompt injection: user input IS code now
- [ ] context budget: what to include when you cant include everything
- [ ] images in: multimodal requests without the mystery
- [ ] CAPSTONE: anatomy of a production prompt

## ARC 6 - RAG: giving the model your data
- [ ] closed-book vs open-book
- [ ] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant
- [ ] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality
- [ ] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context
- [ ] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs
- [ ] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough
- [ ] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap
- [ ] keyword + semantic: hybrid search
- [ ] reranking: cheap search, expensive sort
- [ ] measuring retrieval: recall@k and mrr in plain terms
- [ ] groundedness: did the answer come from the docs
- [ ] CAPSTONE: doc-QA system end to end, every design decision named

## ARC 7 - evals: how you know any of it works
- [ ] "looks good" doesnt scale
- [ ] the golden dataset: 50 examples beat vibes
- [ ] exact match vs semantic scoring
- [ ] llm-as-judge, and its biases
- [ ] the score moved, is it real: why small eval sets lie
- [ ] regression: the prompt change that broke three other things
- [ ] evals in ci: treating prompts like code
- [ ] error analysis: stop guessing, read the failures and bucket them
- [ ] after you ship: thumbs, feedback, and checking quality in the wild
- [ ] CAPSTONE: an eval harness for the arc 6 system

## ARC 8 - running it: speed, cost, and when things break
- [ ] an agent is a while loop with an llm inside
- [ ] when the loop goes wrong: runaway agents and hard stops
- [ ] streaming: why the ui types
- [ ] provider prompt caching: pay less for the part of the prompt that never changes
- [ ] semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice
- [ ] latency and cost budgets: the two numbers that kill llm features
- [ ] rate limits and retries
- [ ] when the provider is down: timeouts, fallbacks, failing gracefully
- [ ] the model changes under you: pinning versions and surviving deprecations
- [ ] observability: logging llm calls like http calls
- [ ] CAPSTONE: what happens after deploy, keeping an llm feature alive

## ARC 9 - the decisions: safety, privacy, and picking your model
- [ ] should this even be an llm: when boring code wins
- [ ] content moderation: the filter in front of and behind the model
- [ ] data leaves the building: pii, redaction, and what the api keeps
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD
baton: 038 closed the made-up answer question by joining two notes that were never joined. 030 had already found the shape and fact split, the format sitting in all 60 tuning examples while each fact sat in exactly one, and 038 says that was never a tuning quirk, its how every answer comes out. the visual was a mermaid flowchart with two starting conditions, an export that really exists and one that never did, funnelling into one identical run of steps: every parameter read from 026, exp and divide from 032, one row wins from 034. two outputs come off it, axios.isAxiosError which is real and axios.retryPolicy which i invented in 037, and a dotted branch labelled "is it true?" dead-ending at "no step here asks". the caveat that keeps it honest is in the prose: the numbers inside the two runs do differ, different prompt, what does not differ is the list of steps, and there is no extra step that fires when its inventing. so the no-patch half of the checkbox is landed, theres no branch to put an if into. 038 deliberately left one door open and pointed at it: 037s two lists topped out at 14% and 68%, so the winning percentage looks like it might be the tell. 039 must walk through that door and take it away. the checkbox is "asking the model how sure it is, and why you cant trust the answer", and it has two distinct things to separate. one, the softmax percentage from 032 is not a probability of being correct, its how strongly this row beat the other rows, and 035 and 036 both rescale it, so the number moves when you change a sampling knob without anything about the truth changing. two, asking the model in words how confident it is just runs the same loop from 022 over tokens like "i am highly confident", which are picked the same way any other tokens are, so its a generated string, not a readout. keep 039 off calibration research and off mitigations, arc 7 measures things.
last visuals: mermaid flowchart (038), worked example (037), worked example (036). mermaid just ran, so 039 must not use a flowchart. a comparison table has not appeared since 035.
last exits: forward (038), stops (037), stops (036). one forward running, so 039 may go either way.
