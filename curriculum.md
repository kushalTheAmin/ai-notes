- [x] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant (057)
- [x] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality (058)
- [x] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context (059)
- [x] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs (060)
- [x] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough (061)
- [x] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap (062)
- [x] keyword search: the literal word match, and what it catches that meaning misses (063)

- [ ] redaction: swapping the sensitive parts out before the call, and what you cant swap
- [ ] what the other side keeps: retention, training, and the logs that are yours
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD

baton: 101 opened the request body and counted where the personal data came from. the visual was an annotated jsonc array, four blocks with one comment each, a system message that ships forever, an elided run of 11 earlier turns still attached (047), a retrieved chunk (059) holding another customers ticket, and at the bottom the single line a human actually typed today. the walk was that everything above that last line is code i wrote attaching things. the surprise the note spends itself on is that 061 already filters retrieval by permission, so the bot is allowed to read that ticket, and allowed to read is a different question from ready to leave the building, which i had filed as one question. the caveat that keeps it true is that none of it is automatically wrong, the chunk is there because the answer needs it. it closes by separating the leaving from the logging, 097 made logging prompt text a decision but the data leaves on every call before any log line exists. exit pointed forward at 102.

next is "redaction: swapping the sensitive parts out before the call, and what you cant swap". 101 named whats in the envelope and deliberately did not fix any of it, so 102 is the fix and it must not re-open the audit. the shape wants a before-and-after on ONE field, the swap out to a placeholder and the swap back on the way in, so the reader sees both directions. the honest half is the part you cant swap without breaking the answer, and the fact that spotting whats sensitive is another classifier wrong in two directions, which 100 already established, so build on it in one clause, dont re-teach it. retention and whether the provider keeps anything belongs to 103, not here.

caches stay laid and closed, arc 8 owns all of them and 098 owns the assembly, dont let arc 9 reopen a mechanism. bm25 scoring is still an unlaid brick on purpose. the flag 097 planted is now being spent across 101, 102 and 103, the three checkboxes the original data-leaves-the-building box split into, and nothing outside those three may spend it. 099 deliberately did not name any specific model or provider, and 101 held that line too, arc 9 has a model selection checkbox later and that is where comparisons live.

process note: 095 at 229, 096 at 206, 097 at 216, 098 at 324 as a capstone, 099 at 217, 100 at 216, 101 at 182. 101 came in short on purpose after four notes riding just over the band and it reads better for it, so hold 102 in the 170 to 210 range.

last visuals: annotated jsonc request array, four content blocks with one comment each (101), mermaid flowchart, seven nodes, two gates with a blocked branch off each (100), comparison table, three columns and five rows, one job per row from a single support inbox (099). no type repeats yet, 102 is free, though an annotated artifact two notes running would be worth avoiding.
last exits: forward (101), stops (100), forward (099). two of the last three point forward, so 102 must just stop.

process note on visuals: mermaid stacks subgraphs in whatever order it likes and it flipped the two on 065, and on 070 it put the once-per-doc group beside the per-question one rather than above it. so 070s prose says "one group" and "the other group" instead of top and bottom, and 098 names its groups seconds, minutes and months for the same reason. do not write positional references into prose about a mermaid block, github may lay it out differently than a local render. tables are safe for this, 099 says "top row" and "row two" and github renders rows in file order.
