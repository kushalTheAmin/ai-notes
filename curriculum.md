# curriculum

## ARC 1 - how machines read text
- [x] characters vs words, and why both fail (001)
- [x] what a token is (002)
- [x] BPE: merging by frequency (003)
- [x] tokens are money: how pricing actually works (004)
- [x] why hindi and gujarati cost more than english: tokens per word isnt equal (005)
- [x] context window (006)
- [x] the model cant see inside a token: why it cant count letters (007)
- [x] numbers get chunked, not counted: why arithmetic gets shaky (008)
- [x] a space or a capital letter changes the ids (009)
- [x] CAPSTONE: what the model sees, and what it costs, when i send a request (010)

## ARC 2 - meaning as numbers
- [x] a vector is a list of numbers (011)
- [x] dot product, by hand (012)
- [x] cosine similarity (013)
- [x] what an embedding is (014)
- [x] nearby means similar (015)
- [x] one word, many meanings: context changes the vector (016)
- [x] embedding models are separate products from chat models (017)
- [x] classify with no training: nearest labeled example wins (018)
- [x] near-duplicates: the same score, with a threshold on it (019)
- [x] clustering: finding the groups when nothing is labeled (020)
- [x] CAPSTONE: how search by meaning works end to end (021)

## ARC 3 - whats inside the box (enough to not be fooled, no more)
- [x] next-token prediction is the whole game (022)
- [x] attention in one note: every token looks at every other token, the superpower and the cost (023)
- [x] why compute scales badly with input length (024)
- [x] a parameter is one number the model learned, and 8B is how many (025)
- [x] the model reads every parameter to write one token (026)
- [x] what a bigger model actually buys, and what it doesnt (027)
- [x] training vs inference: baked-in knowledge has a cutoff (028)
- [x] base model vs assistant: what tuning changed (029)
- [x] what fine-tuning can fix and what it cant (030)
- [x] CAPSTONE: the box, closed. everything an applied engineer must know about internals and nothing more (031)

## ARC 4 - how it writes, and the knobs you own
- [x] logits to probabilities (032)
- [x] temperature (033)
- [x] greedy vs sampling: two ways to pick a row (034)
- [x] top-k: keep the best few rows, then rescale what survives (035)
- [x] top-p: cut by running total, and why a fixed k gets it wrong (036)
- [x] theres no row for "i dont know": the list always adds to 100 and something always wins (037)
- [x] why the made-up answer sounds right, and why its not a bug you can patch (038)
- [x] asking the model how sure it is, and why you cant trust the answer (039)
- [ ] stop sequences and max tokens
- [ ] determinism: why the same prompt varies and what that breaks
- [ ] reasoning models: when the model thinks first, and what those tokens cost
- [ ] CAPSTONE: one tokens journey out, and every knob you control

## ARC 5 - the prompt is the program
- [ ] system vs user messages: who outranks whom
- [ ] conversation state: the model remembers nothing, your code fakes the memory
- [ ] few-shot: showing beats telling
- [ ] structured output: getting json you can actually parse
- [ ] when json breaks: validation and retry
- [ ] tool calling: the model asks, your code acts
- [ ] prompt injection: user input IS code now
- [ ] context budget: what to include when you cant include everything
- [ ] images in: multimodal requests without the mystery
- [ ] CAPSTONE: anatomy of a production prompt

## ARC 6 - RAG: giving the model your data
- [ ] closed-book vs open-book
- [ ] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant
- [ ] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality
- [ ] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context
- [ ] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs
- [ ] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough
- [ ] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap
- [ ] keyword + semantic: hybrid search
- [ ] reranking: cheap search, expensive sort
- [ ] measuring retrieval: recall@k and mrr in plain terms
- [ ] groundedness: did the answer come from the docs
- [ ] CAPSTONE: doc-QA system end to end, every design decision named

## ARC 7 - evals: how you know any of it works
- [ ] "looks good" doesnt scale
- [ ] the golden dataset: 50 examples beat vibes
- [ ] exact match vs semantic scoring
- [ ] llm-as-judge, and its biases
- [ ] the score moved, is it real: why small eval sets lie
- [ ] regression: the prompt change that broke three other things
- [ ] evals in ci: treating prompts like code
- [ ] error analysis: stop guessing, read the failures and bucket them
- [ ] after you ship: thumbs, feedback, and checking quality in the wild
- [ ] CAPSTONE: an eval harness for the arc 6 system

## ARC 8 - running it: speed, cost, and when things break
- [ ] an agent is a while loop with an llm inside
- [ ] when the loop goes wrong: runaway agents and hard stops
- [ ] streaming: why the ui types
- [ ] provider prompt caching: pay less for the part of the prompt that never changes
- [ ] semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice
- [ ] latency and cost budgets: the two numbers that kill llm features
- [ ] rate limits and retries
- [ ] when the provider is down: timeouts, fallbacks, failing gracefully
- [ ] the model changes under you: pinning versions and surviving deprecations
- [ ] observability: logging llm calls like http calls
- [ ] CAPSTONE: what happens after deploy, keeping an llm feature alive

## ARC 9 - the decisions: safety, privacy, and picking your model
- [ ] should this even be an llm: when boring code wins
- [ ] content moderation: the filter in front of and behind the model
- [ ] data leaves the building: pii, redaction, and what the api keeps
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD
baton: 039 shut the door 038 deliberately left open. 038 ended on a crumb, 037s real list topped at 68% and the invented one at 14%, so maybe the winning percentage is the tell. 039 says no, twice. route one, the number: 14.0% is a statement about rows, this word beat the other words by this much, and nothing in the loop checked the claim. worse, its not even a fixed number. put top-k at 4 from 035 and the tail is deleted, the four survivors rescale, 14.0 divided by 41.5 is 33.7, so the number more than doubled off a knob that has nothing to do with axios. route two, ask it in words: "how sure are you" is a question, so what comes back is tokens out of the same loop, and it says highly confident about the invented retryPolicy in the same steady voice it uses for the real isAxiosError. the caveat that keeps it honest is in the prose, the number does carry something, a top row down at 14% usually means the model was torn between words, but torn between words is not the same as catching itself making things up. the visual was a 14 line pseudocode block, the fantasy call answer, confidence = ask(...) up top with an if confidence < 0.8 guard, then the real per-token loop tagged 026, 032, 034, then both routes hanging off it. the note ends flat, theres no readout, you thought you were reading a gauge and it was just more output. so arc 4 has now spent three notes (037, 038, 039) on what the loop will not tell you. the next checkbox is "stop sequences and max tokens" and it turns the camera the other way, to what actually makes the loop stop. it should pick up the one thing 037 named and nobody has built on yet, the real done token that wins a row like any other token and breaks the loop, and put the two things you control next to it: a string you hand the api that makes it cut as soon as that text appears, and a hard token ceiling. the honest beat there is that a max tokens stop is not a finished answer, the loop was mid-sentence and you cut it, so the reply comes back truncated with a finish reason you have to check. keep it off streaming, arc 8 has that.
last visuals: pseudocode (039), mermaid flowchart (038), worked example (037). pseudocode just ran, so 040 must not use one. a comparison table has not appeared since 035, and thats now five notes.
last exits: stops (039), forward (038), stops (037). two of the last three just stop, so 040 may go either way.
