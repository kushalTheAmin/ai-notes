# curriculum

## ARC 1 - how machines read text
- [x] characters vs words, and why both fail (001)
- [x] what a token is (002)
- [x] BPE: merging by frequency (003)
- [x] tokens are money: how pricing actually works (004)
- [x] why hindi and gujarati cost more than english: tokens per word isnt equal (005)
- [x] context window (006)
- [x] the model cant see inside a token: why it cant count letters (007)
- [x] numbers get chunked, not counted: why arithmetic gets shaky (008)
- [x] a space or a capital letter changes the ids (009)
- [x] CAPSTONE: what the model sees, and what it costs, when i send a request (010)

## ARC 2 - meaning as numbers
- [x] a vector is a list of numbers (011)
- [x] dot product, by hand (012)
- [x] cosine similarity (013)
- [x] what an embedding is (014)
- [x] nearby means similar (015)
- [x] one word, many meanings: context changes the vector (016)
- [x] embedding models are separate products from chat models (017)
- [x] classify with no training: nearest labeled example wins (018)
- [x] near-duplicates: the same score, with a threshold on it (019)
- [x] clustering: finding the groups when nothing is labeled (020)
- [x] CAPSTONE: how search by meaning works end to end (021)

## ARC 3 - whats inside the box (enough to not be fooled, no more)
- [x] next-token prediction is the whole game (022)
- [x] attention in one note: every token looks at every other token, the superpower and the cost (023)
- [x] why compute scales badly with input length (024)
- [x] a parameter is one number the model learned, and 8B is how many (025)
- [x] the model reads every parameter to write one token (026)
- [x] what a bigger model actually buys, and what it doesnt (027)
- [x] training vs inference: baked-in knowledge has a cutoff (028)
- [x] base model vs assistant: what tuning changed (029)
- [x] what fine-tuning can fix and what it cant (030)
- [x] CAPSTONE: the box, closed. everything an applied engineer must know about internals and nothing more (031)

## ARC 4 - how it writes, and the knobs you own
- [x] logits to probabilities (032)
- [x] temperature (033)
- [x] greedy vs sampling: two ways to pick a row (034)
- [x] top-k: keep the best few rows, then rescale what survives (035)
- [x] top-p: cut by running total, and why a fixed k gets it wrong (036)
- [x] theres no row for "i dont know": the list always adds to 100 and something always wins (037)
- [x] why the made-up answer sounds right, and why its not a bug you can patch (038)
- [x] asking the model how sure it is, and why you cant trust the answer (039)
- [x] stop sequences and max tokens (040)
- [x] determinism: why the same prompt varies and what that breaks (041)
- [x] reasoning models: the model does its working out in the open (042)
- [x] thinking tokens on the bill: paying for output you dont get to read (043)
- [x] CAPSTONE: one tokens journey out, and every knob you control (044)

## ARC 5 - the prompt is the program
- [x] the request is a list of role-tagged messages, and it all becomes one token stream (045)
- [x] system vs user: what outranking buys you, and what it doesnt (046)
- [x] conversation state: the model remembers nothing, your code fakes the memory (047)
- [x] few-shot: showing beats telling (048)
- [x] structured output: getting json you can actually parse (049)
- [x] when json breaks: validation and retry (050)
- [x] tool calling: the model asks, your code acts (051)
- [x] prompt injection: user input IS code now (052)
- [x] context budget: what to include when you cant include everything (053)
- [x] images in: multimodal requests without the mystery (054)
- [x] CAPSTONE: anatomy of a production prompt (055)

## ARC 6 - RAG: giving the model your data
- [x] closed-book vs open-book (056)
- [x] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant (057)
- [x] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality (058)
- [x] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context (059)
- [ ] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs
- [ ] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough
- [ ] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap
- [ ] keyword + semantic: hybrid search
- [ ] reranking: cheap search, expensive sort
- [ ] measuring retrieval: recall@k and mrr in plain terms
- [ ] groundedness: did the answer come from the docs
- [ ] CAPSTONE: doc-QA system end to end, every design decision named

## ARC 7 - evals: how you know any of it works
- [ ] "looks good" doesnt scale
- [ ] the golden dataset: 50 examples beat vibes
- [ ] exact match vs semantic scoring
- [ ] llm-as-judge, and its biases
- [ ] the score moved, is it real: why small eval sets lie
- [ ] regression: the prompt change that broke three other things
- [ ] evals in ci: treating prompts like code
- [ ] error analysis: stop guessing, read the failures and bucket them
- [ ] after you ship: thumbs, feedback, and checking quality in the wild
- [ ] CAPSTONE: an eval harness for the arc 6 system

## ARC 8 - running it: speed, cost, and when things break
- [ ] an agent is a while loop with an llm inside
- [ ] when the loop goes wrong: runaway agents and hard stops
- [ ] streaming: why the ui types
- [ ] provider prompt caching: pay less for the part of the prompt that never changes
- [ ] semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice
- [ ] latency and cost budgets: the two numbers that kill llm features
- [ ] rate limits and retries
- [ ] when the provider is down: timeouts, fallbacks, failing gracefully
- [ ] the model changes under you: pinning versions and surviving deprecations
- [ ] observability: logging llm calls like http calls
- [ ] CAPSTONE: what happens after deploy, keeping an llm feature alive

## ARC 9 - the decisions: safety, privacy, and picking your model
- [ ] should this even be an llm: when boring code wins
- [ ] content moderation: the filter in front of and behind the model
- [ ] data leaves the building: pii, redaction, and what the api keeps
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD
baton: 059 wired the pipeline. what it established: embed every chunk once when the doc lands, embed the question at ask time, cosine against the store, take the top 3, then join those chunk strings and glue them onto the question. the line that carries: there is no documents parameter, retrieved text arrives as characters in the user message like any other text, so the model cannot tell it apart from what i typed. it dropped two plain sentences as caveats, one that a provider file-search feature is doing this same assembly on their side, and one that the loop over every stored array is free at 400 chunks and not at 4 million.

the next checkbox is "where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs". it picks the baton straight up from that second caveat, the for loop over every array. the note is what replaces the loop: an index that skips most of the arrays instead of scoring all of them, and the trade that buys the speed, which is that it can miss a real neighbour. 013 and 021 built exact scoring, so the honest framing is that exact was never sacred, it was just what a small loop gave for free. keep the algorithm names out of it, the reader needs the shape of the trade, not the internals. one small number comparison would land it, scoring 4 million arrays versus touching a few thousand.

process note: 057 landed at 206, 058 at 214, 059 at 231. drifting up. next one should aim 170 to 190 and mean it.

last visuals: pseudocode block, ten lines, the whole pipeline as code (059), three-column comparison table of cut strategies (058), worked cost table in a plain code block (057). code just ran, so the next one wants a table or a mermaid diagram, and a mermaid has not run since 021.
last exits: stops (059), forward (058), stops (057). the next can go either way.
