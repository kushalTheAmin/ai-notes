# curriculum

## ARC 1 - how machines read text
- [x] characters vs words, and why both fail (001)
- [x] what a token is (002)
- [x] BPE: merging by frequency (003)
- [x] tokens are money: how pricing actually works (004)
- [x] why hindi and gujarati cost more than english: tokens per word isnt equal (005)
- [x] context window (006)
- [x] the model cant see inside a token: why it cant count letters (007)
- [x] numbers get chunked, not counted: why arithmetic gets shaky (008)
- [x] a space or a capital letter changes the ids (009)
- [x] CAPSTONE: what the model sees, and what it costs, when i send a request (010)

## ARC 2 - meaning as numbers
- [x] a vector is a list of numbers (011)
- [x] dot product, by hand (012)
- [x] cosine similarity (013)
- [x] what an embedding is (014)
- [x] nearby means similar (015)
- [x] one word, many meanings: context changes the vector (016)
- [x] embedding models are separate products from chat models (017)
- [x] classify with no training: nearest labeled example wins (018)
- [x] near-duplicates: the same score, with a threshold on it (019)
- [x] clustering: finding the groups when nothing is labeled (020)
- [x] CAPSTONE: how search by meaning works end to end (021)

## ARC 3 - whats inside the box (enough to not be fooled, no more)
- [x] next-token prediction is the whole game (022)
- [x] attention in one note: every token looks at every other token, the superpower and the cost (023)
- [x] why compute scales badly with input length (024)
- [x] a parameter is one number the model learned, and 8B is how many (025)
- [x] the model reads every parameter to write one token (026)
- [x] what a bigger model actually buys, and what it doesnt (027)
- [x] training vs inference: baked-in knowledge has a cutoff (028)
- [x] base model vs assistant: what tuning changed (029)
- [x] what fine-tuning can fix and what it cant (030)
- [x] CAPSTONE: the box, closed. everything an applied engineer must know about internals and nothing more (031)

## ARC 4 - how it writes, and the knobs you own
- [x] logits to probabilities (032)
- [x] temperature (033)
- [ ] greedy vs sampling, top-p
- [ ] why models make things up, and why its not a bug you can patch
- [ ] asking the model how sure it is, and why you cant trust the answer
- [ ] stop sequences and max tokens
- [ ] determinism: why the same prompt varies and what that breaks
- [ ] reasoning models: when the model thinks first, and what those tokens cost
- [ ] CAPSTONE: one tokens journey out, and every knob you control

## ARC 5 - the prompt is the program
- [ ] system vs user messages: who outranks whom
- [ ] conversation state: the model remembers nothing, your code fakes the memory
- [ ] few-shot: showing beats telling
- [ ] structured output: getting json you can actually parse
- [ ] when json breaks: validation and retry
- [ ] tool calling: the model asks, your code acts
- [ ] prompt injection: user input IS code now
- [ ] context budget: what to include when you cant include everything
- [ ] images in: multimodal requests without the mystery
- [ ] CAPSTONE: anatomy of a production prompt

## ARC 6 - RAG: giving the model your data
- [ ] closed-book vs open-book
- [ ] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant
- [ ] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality
- [ ] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context
- [ ] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs
- [ ] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough
- [ ] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap
- [ ] keyword + semantic: hybrid search
- [ ] reranking: cheap search, expensive sort
- [ ] measuring retrieval: recall@k and mrr in plain terms
- [ ] groundedness: did the answer come from the docs
- [ ] CAPSTONE: doc-QA system end to end, every design decision named

## ARC 7 - evals: how you know any of it works
- [ ] "looks good" doesnt scale
- [ ] the golden dataset: 50 examples beat vibes
- [ ] exact match vs semantic scoring
- [ ] llm-as-judge, and its biases
- [ ] the score moved, is it real: why small eval sets lie
- [ ] regression: the prompt change that broke three other things
- [ ] evals in ci: treating prompts like code
- [ ] error analysis: stop guessing, read the failures and bucket them
- [ ] after you ship: thumbs, feedback, and checking quality in the wild
- [ ] CAPSTONE: an eval harness for the arc 6 system

## ARC 8 - running it: speed, cost, and when things break
- [ ] an agent is a while loop with an llm inside
- [ ] when the loop goes wrong: runaway agents and hard stops
- [ ] streaming: why the ui types
- [ ] provider prompt caching: pay less for the part of the prompt that never changes
- [ ] semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice
- [ ] latency and cost budgets: the two numbers that kill llm features
- [ ] rate limits and retries
- [ ] when the provider is down: timeouts, fallbacks, failing gracefully
- [ ] the model changes under you: pinning versions and surviving deprecations
- [ ] observability: logging llm calls like http calls
- [ ] CAPSTONE: what happens after deploy, keeping an llm feature alive

## ARC 9 - the decisions: safety, privacy, and picking your model
- [ ] should this even be an llm: when boring code wins
- [ ] content moderation: the filter in front of and behind the model
- [ ] data leaves the building: pii, redaction, and what the api keeps
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD
baton: 033 took the gap 032 ended on and named the knob that controls it. temperature is one divide, applied to every raw score before the exp step, and thats the entire mechanism, there is nothing else to it. re-ran 032s exact four rows (3.2 / 2.1 / 1.0 / -0.4) at three settings: 0.4 gives 93.6 / 6.0 / 0.4 / 0.0, 1.0 gives 032s original 68.0 / 22.6 / 7.5 / 1.9, 2.0 gives 48.2 / 27.8 / 16.0 / 8.0. small divisor spreads the scores apart so the leader runs away with it, big divisor squashes them together so the losers get real odds. also paid off the promise from 017 where temperature sat unexplained in a request json. the caveat 033 planted, and the exact thing the next note must pick up: dividing every score by the same positive number cannot reorder them, so the ranking is identical at every temperature, and 033 says out loud that if whatever comes next always grabs the top row then temperature does nothing at all. that is the setup for greedy vs sampling and top-p. greedy IS always grabbing the top row, so the next note explains why temperature is dead under it, then what sampling does instead (roll against the percentages) and how top-p trims the tail before the roll. the percentages are now fully built and correct, so the next note needs no new arithmetic, it needs to show the act of choosing. still nothing has been picked in the whole arc.
last visuals: worked example (033), worked example (032), mermaid (031). two worked examples running, so 034 must NOT be a worked example, use mermaid or pseudocode.
last exits: forward (033), forward (032), stops (031). two forwards running, so 034 must just stop.
