## ARC 1 - how machines read text
- [x] characters vs words, and why both fail (001)
- [x] what a token is (002)
- [x] BPE: merging by frequency (003)
- [x] tokens are money: how pricing actually works (004)
- [x] why hindi and gujarati cost more than english: tokens per word isnt equal (005)
- [x] context window (006)
- [x] the model cant see inside a token: why it cant count letters (007)
- [x] numbers get chunked, not counted: why arithmetic gets shaky (008)

- [x] cosine similarity (013)
- [x] what an embedding is (014)
- [x] nearby means similar (015)
- [x] one word, many meanings: context changes the vector (016)
- [x] embedding models are separate products from chat models (017)

- [x] clustering: finding the groups when nothing is labeled (020)
- [x] CAPSTONE: how search by meaning works end to end (021)

## ARC 3 - whats inside the box (enough to not be fooled, no more)
- [x] next-token prediction is the whole game (022)
- [x] attention in one note: every token looks at every other token, the superpower and the cost (023)
- [x] why compute scales badly with input length (024)
- [x] a parameter is one number the model learned, and 8B is how many (025)

## ARC 4 - how it writes, and the knobs you own
- [x] logits to probabilities (032)
- [x] temperature (033)
- [x] greedy vs sampling: two ways to pick a row (034)
- [x] top-k: keep the best few rows, then rescale what survives (035)
- [x] top-p: cut by running total, and why a fixed k gets it wrong (036)
- [x] theres no row for "i dont know": the list always adds to 100 and something always wins (037)
- [x] why the made-up answer sounds right, and why its not a bug you can patch (038)
- [x] asking the model how sure it is, and why you cant trust the answer (039)
- [x] stop sequences and max tokens (040)
- [x] determinism: why the same prompt varies and what that breaks (041)
- [x] reasoning models: the model does its working out in the open (042)
- [x] thinking tokens on the bill: paying for output you dont get to read (043)
- [x] CAPSTONE: one tokens journey out, and every knob you control (044)

## ARC 5 - the prompt is the program
- [x] the request is a list of role-tagged messages, and it all becomes one token stream (045)
- [x] system vs user: what outranking buys you, and what it doesnt (046)
- [x] conversation state: the model remembers nothing, your code fakes the memory (047)
- [x] few-shot: showing beats telling (048)
- [x] structured output: getting json you can actually parse (049)
- [x] when json breaks: validation and retry (050)

- [x] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant (057)
- [x] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality (058)
- [x] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context (059)
- [x] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs (060)
- [x] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough (061)
- [x] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap (062)
- [x] keyword search: the literal word match, and what it catches that meaning misses (063)
- [x] hybrid: merging two ranked lists when the scores dont compare (064)
- [x] the reranker: one model reads your question and the chunk together (065)
- [x] two-stage retrieval: search wide and cheap, sort narrow and expensive (066)
- [x] recall@k: did the right chunk come back at all (067)
- [x] mrr: recall throws away where in the list it landed (068)

- [x] the score moved, is it real: why small eval sets lie (076)
- [x] regression: the prompt change that broke three other things (077)
- [x] evals in ci: treating prompts like code (078)

- [x] CAPSTONE: an eval harness for the arc 6 system (081)

## ARC 8 - running it: speed, cost, and when things break
- [x] an agent is a while loop with an llm inside (082)
- [x] when the loop goes wrong: runaway agents and hard stops (083)
- [x] streaming: why the ui types (084)
- [x] provider prompt caching: pay less for the part of the prompt that never changes (085)
- [ ] semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice
- [ ] latency and cost budgets: the two numbers that kill llm features
- [ ] rate limits and retries
- [ ] when the provider is down: timeouts, fallbacks, failing gracefully
- [ ] the model changes under you: pinning versions and surviving deprecations
- [ ] observability: logging llm calls like http calls
- [ ] CAPSTONE: what happens after deploy, keeping an llm feature alive

## ARC 9 - the decisions: safety, privacy, and picking your model
- [ ] should this even be an llm: when boring code wins
- [ ] content moderation: the filter in front of and behind the model
- [ ] data leaves the building: pii, redaction, and what the api keeps
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD
baton: 085 finally spent the debt 047 and 083 ran up. the array has a front section that is byte identical on every call, system plus tool definitions plus few-shot, and the provider keeps the processed version of it for a few minutes and charges about a tenth to reuse it. worked example was 4,000 cached tokens plus a 200 token question, 4,200 becoming 600. the two constraints that matter downstream: it is an exact prefix match from the very start, so anything variable has to sit at the bottom of the array, and there is a rough thousand token minimum. caveats already stated once, a small write premium on some apis and automatic caching on others.

next is "semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice". this is a genuinely different idea from 085 and the note has to say so early or the reader will merge them. 085 caches the prompt work on an exact byte match and the model still runs. semantic caching skips the model call entirely by returning a stored answer, and the match is fuzzy, its 013 cosine on the question embedding against questions youve already answered. so the new risks are the near-miss hit, two questions that score 0.93 but want different answers, and staleness. 041 already noted in passing that a cache can hold two right answers under one key, thats fair to pick up.

the latency and cost budget note still owns the budget material, dont spend it early. 085 mentioned the latency win from a cache hit in one clause only, thats enough.

bm25 scoring stayed a missing brick through all of arc 6 and that was correct. 064 prints a keyword score as a bare number on purpose, since the point is that the scale is unknowable to you. it stays unlaid, dont let a later arc drag it in.

process note: 079 at 208, 080 at 217, 081 at 346 (capstone ceiling), 082 at 190, 083 at 176, 084 at 194, 085 at 179. the short run is holding, 176 to 194 across the last four. 086 can go a bit longer without it reading as bloat, 200 to 230 is fine.

last visuals: annotated artifact, the posted array with the cache marker drawn across it and the two bills computed underneath (085), comparison table, three columns and three rows putting first text on screen, last word on screen, and what the code holds side by side for one shot and streaming (084), worked example, one question traced round by round with the send size and the running bill in three columns (083). a mermaid diagram is free next and semantic caching has an obvious flowchart shape, question in, close enough match or not, stored answer or a real model call.
last exits: stops (085), forward (084), stops (083). 086 is free to point forward.

process note on visuals: mermaid stacks subgraphs in whatever order it likes and it flipped the two on 065, and on 070 it put the once-per-doc group beside the per-question one rather than above it. so 070s prose says "one group" and "the other group" instead of top and bottom. do not write positional references into prose about a mermaid block, github may lay it out differently than a local render.
