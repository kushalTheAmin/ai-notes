## ARC 3 - whats inside the box (enough to not be fooled, no more)
- [x] next-token prediction is the whole game (022)
- [x] attention in one note: every token looks at every other token, the superpower and the cost (023)
- [x] why compute scales badly with input length (024)
- [x] a parameter is one number the model learned, and 8B is how many (025)

- [x] CAPSTONE: one tokens journey out, and every knob you control (044)

## ARC 5 - the prompt is the program
- [x] the request is a list of role-tagged messages, and it all becomes one token stream (045)
- [x] system vs user: what outranking buys you, and what it doesnt (046)
- [x] conversation state: the model remembers nothing, your code fakes the memory (047)
- [x] few-shot: showing beats telling (048)

- [x] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant (057)
- [x] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality (058)
- [x] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context (059)
- [x] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs (060)
- [x] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough (061)
- [x] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap (062)
- [x] keyword search: the literal word match, and what it catches that meaning misses (063)
- [x] hybrid: merging two ranked lists when the scores dont compare (064)
- [x] the reranker: one model reads your question and the chunk together (065)
- [x] two-stage retrieval: search wide and cheap, sort narrow and expensive (066)
- [x] recall@k: did the right chunk come back at all (067)
- [x] mrr: recall throws away where in the list it landed (068)

- [x] CAPSTONE: an eval harness for the arc 6 system (081)

## ARC 8 - running it: speed, cost, and when things break
- [x] an agent is a while loop with an llm inside (082)
- [x] when the loop goes wrong: runaway agents and hard stops (083)
- [x] streaming: why the ui types (084)
- [x] provider prompt caching: pay less for the part of the prompt that never changes (085)
- [x] semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice (086)
- [x] latency and cost budgets: the two numbers that kill llm features (087)
- [x] rate limits: two meters, requests a minute and tokens a minute (088)
- [x] retrying a 429: wait, then double the wait (089)
- [x] jitter: when every client retries at the same moment (090)
- [x] which errors are worth retrying, and which never are (091)

- [ ] CAPSTONE: what happens after deploy, keeping an llm feature alive

## ARC 9 - the decisions: safety, privacy, and picking your model
- [ ] should this even be an llm: when boring code wins
- [ ] content moderation: the filter in front of and behind the model
- [ ] data leaves the building: pii, redaction, and what the api keeps
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD
baton: 092 put a number on the wait. the establishing move is that the timeout exists whether you picked it or not, some sdk clients sit at ten minutes and browser fetch has no limit at all without an abort signal, so "i didnt set one" reads as forever. the click is that the timeout is not the wait: 089s five attempts multiply it and stack the 15 seconds of sleeps on top, so 30 seconds is 165, 5 seconds is 40, and even 5 seconds with 2 attempts is 11 against 087s 1 second budget. so the timeout and the attempt count are one decision. the streaming caveat is laid: with 084 you time the wait to the first token, not the whole answer. 092 did not touch which codes retry (091) or the backoff shape (089), and it deliberately said nothing about what happens after the last attempt.

next is "fallback: a second model when the first one is down". it picks up the number 092 just made concrete. 092 ends the moment the clock runs out on the last attempt and does not say what happens next, so this note starts exactly there, at give_up() from 089, and the material is the second call: a different model or a different provider, why it is a real call with its own latency and its own price and its own output shape, and the fact that your prompt was tuned against model one. it must not re-derive the timeout math, thats 092, and it must not touch what the user sees when the fallback also dies, thats the note after. a mermaid flowchart of one call with the give-up branch feeding a second provider is the obvious shape, and mermaid is very much free, no diagram in the last four.

caches stay laid and closed. 085 owns exact prefix caching, 086 owns fuzzy question matching, 087 owns the two budget numbers, 088 owns the meters, 089 owns backoff, 090 owns jitter, 091 owns retryable vs never, 092 owns the timeout number. bm25 scoring is still an unlaid brick on purpose, dont let arc 8 or 9 drag it in.

process note: 085 at 179, 086 at 234, 087 at 207, 088 at 223, 089 at 212, 090 at 202, 091 at 196, 092 at 172. the 176 to 215 band is where this arc reads best and 092 sat just under it because the arithmetic block carried the load. 093 has a diagram doing the work too, so low in the band is fine again.

last visuals: worked example, four timeout choices with the calls and the sleeps added up to what the user actually waits (092), comparison table, seven status codes with retry or never and the reason in the third column (091), worked example, a timeline of four workers waking on one tick with the calls stacked, against the same four with a random slice added (090). no worked example for 093, thats two of the last three.
last exits: stops (092), forward (091), stops (090). 092 stopped, so 093 may end either way.

process note on visuals: mermaid stacks subgraphs in whatever order it likes and it flipped the two on 065, and on 070 it put the once-per-doc group beside the per-question one rather than above it. so 070s prose says "one group" and "the other group" instead of top and bottom. do not write positional references into prose about a mermaid block, github may lay it out differently than a local render.
