## ARC 1 - how machines read text
- [x] characters vs words, and why both fail (001)
- [x] what a token is (002)
- [x] BPE: merging by frequency (003)
- [x] tokens are money: how pricing actually works (004)
- [x] why hindi and gujarati cost more than english: tokens per word isnt equal (005)
- [x] context window (006)
- [x] the model cant see inside a token: why it cant count letters (007)
- [x] numbers get chunked, not counted: why arithmetic gets shaky (008)

- [x] cosine similarity (013)
- [x] what an embedding is (014)
- [x] nearby means similar (015)
- [x] one word, many meanings: context changes the vector (016)

- [x] clustering: finding the groups when nothing is labeled (020)
- [x] CAPSTONE: how search by meaning works end to end (021)

## ARC 3 - whats inside the box (enough to not be fooled, no more)
- [x] next-token prediction is the whole game (022)
- [x] attention in one note: every token looks at every other token, the superpower and the cost (023)
- [x] why compute scales badly with input length (024)
- [x] a parameter is one number the model learned, and 8B is how many (025)
- [x] the model reads every parameter to write one token (026)
- [x] what a bigger model actually buys, and what it doesnt (027)
- [x] training vs inference: baked-in knowledge has a cutoff (028)
- [x] base model vs assistant: what tuning changed (029)
- [x] what fine-tuning can fix and what it cant (030)
- [x] CAPSTONE: the box, closed. everything an applied engineer must know about internals and nothing more (031)

## ARC 4 - how it writes, and the knobs you own
- [x] logits to probabilities (032)
- [x] temperature (033)
- [x] greedy vs sampling: two ways to pick a row (034)
- [x] top-k: keep the best few rows, then rescale what survives (035)
- [x] top-p: cut by running total, and why a fixed k gets it wrong (036)
- [x] theres no row for "i dont know": the list always adds to 100 and something always wins (037)
- [x] why the made-up answer sounds right, and why its not a bug you can patch (038)
- [x] asking the model how sure it is, and why you cant trust the answer (039)
- [x] stop sequences and max tokens (040)
- [x] determinism: why the same prompt varies and what that breaks (041)
- [x] reasoning models: the model does its working out in the open (042)
- [x] thinking tokens on the bill: paying for output you dont get to read (043)
- [x] CAPSTONE: one tokens journey out, and every knob you control (044)

## ARC 5 - the prompt is the program
- [x] the request is a list of role-tagged messages, and it all becomes one token stream (045)
- [x] system vs user: what outranking buys you, and what it doesnt (046)
- [x] conversation state: the model remembers nothing, your code fakes the memory (047)
- [x] few-shot: showing beats telling (048)
- [x] structured output: getting json you can actually parse (049)
- [x] when json breaks: validation and retry (050)
- [x] tool calling: the model asks, your code acts (051)

- [x] images in: multimodal requests without the mystery (054)
- [x] CAPSTONE: anatomy of a production prompt (055)

## ARC 6 - RAG: giving the model your data
- [x] closed-book vs open-book (056)
- [x] long context vs retrieval: when you can just send everything, and when you cant (057)
- [x] chunking: the decision that quietly decides quality (058)
- [x] retrieval: embed, search, stuff the context (059)
- [x] where vectors live: from scanning every doc to a real index, and what approximate costs (060)
- [x] filtering before searching: metadata, permissions, and why vector search alone isnt enough (061)
- [x] why retrieval fails: the vocabulary gap (062)
- [x] keyword search: the literal word match, and what it catches that meaning misses (063)
- [x] hybrid: merging two ranked lists when the scores dont compare (064)
- [x] the reranker: one model reads your question and the chunk together (065)
- [x] two-stage retrieval: search wide and cheap, sort narrow and expensive (066)
- [x] recall@k: did the right chunk come back at all (067)
- [ ] mrr: recall throws away where in the list it landed
- [ ] groundedness: did the answer come from the docs
- [ ] CAPSTONE: doc-QA system end to end, every design decision named

## ARC 7 - evals: how you know any of it works
- [ ] "looks good" doesnt scale
- [ ] the golden dataset: 50 examples beat vibes
- [ ] exact match vs semantic scoring
- [ ] llm-as-judge, and its biases
- [ ] the score moved, is it real: why small eval sets lie
- [ ] regression: the prompt change that broke three other things
- [ ] evals in ci: treating prompts like code
- [ ] error analysis: stop guessing, read the failures and bucket them
- [ ] after you ship: thumbs, feedback, and checking quality in the wild
- [ ] CAPSTONE: an eval harness for the arc 6 system

## ARC 8 - running it: speed, cost, and when things break
- [ ] an agent is a while loop with an llm inside
- [ ] when the loop goes wrong: runaway agents and hard stops
- [ ] streaming: why the ui types
- [ ] provider prompt caching: pay less for the part of the prompt that never changes
- [ ] semantic caching: the same question twice shouldnt cost twice
- [ ] latency and cost budgets: the two numbers that kill llm features
- [ ] rate limits and retries
- [ ] when the provider is down: timeouts, fallbacks, failing gracefully
- [ ] the model changes under you: pinning versions and surviving deprecations
- [ ] observability: logging llm calls like http calls
- [ ] CAPSTONE: what happens after deploy, keeping an llm feature alive

## ARC 9 - the decisions: safety, privacy, and picking your model
- [ ] should this even be an llm: when boring code wins
- [ ] content moderation: the filter in front of and behind the model
- [ ] data leaves the building: pii, redaction, and what the api keeps
- [ ] designing for wrong: shipping a feature that fails 5% of the time, on purpose
- [ ] api models vs open weights: renting a model vs owning one
- [ ] which lever: prompt harder, add retrieval, or fine-tune
- [ ] model selection: picking by task, not leaderboard
- [ ] CAPSTONE: the checklist i would run before shipping any llm feature

## THREAD
baton: 067 gave a name and a number to the thing 066 could only gesture at. the answer key is hand-written, a question plus the chunk you know answers it, then you run retrieval and write down the rank that chunk actually came back at. recall@k is one yes/no per question, did it land at k or better, averaged over the key. the worked table used ranks 1, 4, 9 and one miss, so recall@5 is 0.50 and recall@10 is 0.75, and the same four rows producing both numbers is what makes k read as a dial rather than a setting. 067 also stated the two limits plainly. rank 1 and rank 9 both count as a plain yes, and the number only covers the questions you bothered to write down. the first of those limits is exactly the next checkbox, and 067 deliberately did not point forward at it, it stated it and stopped, because the exit rule required a stop.

the next checkbox is "mrr: recall throws away where in the list it landed". pick up the rank-1-equals-rank-9 line from 067 by name, that sentence is the whole opening. do not rebuild the answer key, 067 built it, reuse the exact same four rows (ranks 1, 4, 9, miss) so the reader watches the same data produce a different number. one over the rank: 1/1 is 1.0, 1/4 is 0.25, 1/9 is 0.111, a miss scores 0, and the mean of those four is 1.361 divided by 4, which is 0.34. recompute that digit by digit when writing, do not trust this line. 064 already did rank fusion with one over a rank, so the reader has met that arithmetic and leaning on it saves real words. the honest caveat: mrr only looks at the first right chunk and says nothing about the second, and one question sitting at rank 1 can carry an otherwise weak key because 1.0 dwarfs 0.111.

bm25 scoring is still a missing brick and stays one. 064 prints a keyword score as a bare number and never explains its scale, deliberately, since the point is that the scale is unknowable to you.

process note: 064 at 189, 065 at 197, 066 at 201, 067 at 184. 067 landed in range, keep aiming 170 to 190.

last visuals: answer key table with a rank column, plus a plain computed block under it deriving recall@5 and recall@10 off the same four rows (067), ascii funnel with counts and a cost per stage (066), mermaid, two flowcharts side by side (065). 068 wants those same four rows again, so a table two notes running is fine, three would not be.
last exits: stops (067), forward (066), stops (065). only one of the last three points forward, so 068 may point forward.

process note on visuals: mermaid stacks subgraphs in whatever order it likes and it flipped the two on 065, so the prose says "the 059 side" and "the reranker side" instead of top and bottom. do not write positional references into prose about a mermaid block, github may lay it out differently than a local render.
